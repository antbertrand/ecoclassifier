\label{chapter:softwarereqs}

This chapter explains software requirements for the application

\section{Basic Requirements}

The OS is Linux (headless), Debian or Ubuntu.

\todo{Specify OS needs here}

We also need:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Docker, >= 18.0.9
    \item Docker-compose, >= 1.23.2
\end{itemize}

\section{Containers}

The containers deployed on the project are the following:

\subsection{\texttt{ecoclassifier-main}}

This is the container holding the main camera program.

It has the main loop.

\notebox{If we have performance issues and/or problems to keep up with the \gls{heartbeat},
we could add another container to handle the heartbeat specifically.}

Here's the list of software that must be configured on the container:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Python >= 3.6
    \item OpenCV
    \item Snap7 software (for \gls{plc} communication)
    \item Basler software (bundled with our Dockerfile!)
    \item Semi-async mode (main loop for image capture, async mode for the upload part)
    \item Keras
    \item Usual requirements.txt additional packages
\end{itemize}

Plus we have to enable the following service/packages/libraries:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Sentry} (see \url{https://sentry.io}) to report exceptions
    \item \texttt{timeout-decorator} (see \url{https://github.com/pnpnpn/timeout-decorator})
    \item \texttt{Tenacity} (see \url{https://github.com/jd/tenacity})
\end{itemize}
