\label{chapter:hardwarearchitecture}

This chapter explains the general architecture of the project (hardware).

% \section{Hardware architecture}

The eco-classifier project has the following hardware parts:

\begin{itemize}
    \item One front-facing GigE camera
    \item One top-facing GigE camera
    \item Physical cables to connect those to the main PC
    \item A light panel, connected to one of the cameras
    \item A main analysis PC (which is where most of this project should be running)
    \item An ethernet cable connecting the main PC to the Profinet-enabled automate
    \item An outbound (internet) link (out of scope)
\end{itemize}

Nothing more.
